```python
# Get the input from the user
num1 = float(input("Enter first number: "))
num2 = float(input("Enter second number: "))

# Add the two numbers
sum = num1 + num2

# Print the result
print("The sum of {} and {} is: {}".format(num1, num2, sum))
```

You can copy and paste this code into a Python IDE or editor, run the code, and it will prompt you to enter two numbers. Once you enter the numbers, it will calculate and display their sum.
